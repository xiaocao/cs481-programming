      <h3>Programming Style</h3>

    In addition to correctness, your programs will also be graded for
    their style; good programming style should always be adhered to.
    The main principle is that your code should be easily
    understandable (without other help) by someone who knows what the
    program is supposed to do, but not how your program does it.  Some
    general rules of thumb are:
    <UL>
      <LI> No function should be more than about 30 lines of code (GUI
	functions excepted).
      <LI> Each file should only contain closely-related functions
	with similar purposes.  (In Java, each file should contain a
	single class perhaps with subclasses.)
      <LI> All function, variable, type, and class names should be
	descriptive and clear.  E.g, use <tt>FileIndex</tt> instead of
	<tt>i</tt>.
      <LI> Each file should have a header comment at the top
	explaining the purpose of the code in the file, and giving the
	name of the author (and the date of last revision).
      <LI> Each function should have a header comment explaining
	clearly the purpose of the function and any parameters and
	return values (as well as side-effects on the program state).
      <LI> Proper indentation should always be observed.  Never put
	two statements on a single line!
      <LI> Constants in your code should be given a symbolic name,
	either as a <tt>#define</tt> or as a <tt>const</tt>.
      <LI> Functions should not have more than three or four
	parameters, unless <i>absolutely</i> necessary.
      <LI> Use consistent naming and capitalization conventions.
      <LI> Use good spelling.
      <LI> Use inline comments for tricky bits of code whose purpose
	is not immediately obvious.
      <LI> Use appropriate language features (for example, in C, write
	"<tt>FileIndex++;</tt>" instead of "<tt>FileIndex = FileIndex +
	  1;</tt>".
    </UL>

    <h3>Formatting</h3>

    You should hand in a package containing the following documents
(with descriptive filenames!):
    <ol>
      <LI> A README file containing your name and ID
	number, the name of the course, and the number of the
	assignment.  In addition, it should have a brief description of
	the structure of the code as well as a short user's manual, if
	necessary.  This part includes a list of all the source files,
	each with a short description.  If you have modified code that
was given to you, describe briefly and completely the modifications.

      <LI> A file (or files) containing the code itself.  Code should
be properly structured and documented (as noted above).

      <LI> A file containing the raw results of any test runs.

<LI> A file analyzing the results, summarizing the results and
evaluations.  Your evaluation methods, results, and discussion should
be clearly explained and demarcated.  Do not assume that I or the
graders will know (psychically?) what exactly you did, unless you tell
us specifically.  If there are multiple different runs or experiments,
list each separately, with its own heading.

    </OL>

Documents may be in clearly-formatted ASCII, Postscript, or PDF.  Make
sure to ZIP the files together before submitting via Blackboard.
